# vorokite

**vorokite** is the public, open-source core for lightweight Voronoi-style lattice structure with periodic boundary condition (PBC).
> **Note:** The Abaqus-based automated meshing and simulation setup for  in solid element (**.inp export, ODB reading, runners**) is **not** included in this public version. Access to that private add-on is available **upon request** for collaborators or licensing.
